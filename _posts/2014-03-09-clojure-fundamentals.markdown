I haven't this excited when I am learning programming languages. Clojure is a very simple and powerful Lisp dialect on JVM. 

You code as data in Clojure. So my personal feeling is that Lisp dialects should have been the go-to programming language to develop multi-tenant applications like [Workday](http://blogs.workday.com/why_workday_is_different_by_design.html), [Salesforce](http://www.developerforce.com/media/ForcedotcomBookLibrary/Force.com_Multitenancy_WP_101508.pdf). And to create rule engines. There have been some attempts made by [clara-rules](https://github.com/rbrush/clara-rules) and [mimir](https://github.com/hraberg/mimir) projects to create rule engines.
We can store the Clojure code as data in any storage (ex: DB) and read into JVM memory as the semantics and the structures remain the same. It makes Clojure so powerful and elegant to work with.

I would like to list some of the resources that I used to learn Clojure.


* [Alan Dipert](https://github.com/alandipert) has 3-hour course on [pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/clojure-fundamentals-part-one) and you find [course notes](http://alandipert.github.io/oscon2012-clojure) which are highly useful.
